Lehmer random numbers generator implemented in TypeScript/JS

Very often, in my work, I need to generate random numbers with consistent results among various systems - PHP or C# backends, AS3, JS frontends, etc.
The library in this repository implements Lehmer random number generator in TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript).

Also, for implementations for other programming languages, please take a look at:

PHP - 
C# - 
Delphi - 
Java - 
AS3 - 

Work in progres...
